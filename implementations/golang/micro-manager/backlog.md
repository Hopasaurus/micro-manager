# Backlog

Implementation of `project/spec-tools.md` in Go: the library, then the `mm` CLI
wrapper over it, then the GUI service of `project/spec-gui.md`. See
[structure.md](structure.md) for the line format, `../AGENTS.md` for the working
rules, `../project/architecture.md` for how the implementation is put together,
and `../project/plan-gui.md` for the phasing of T-0046 onward. T-0128 onward
(tagged `flicker-fix`, phased `phase-1`…`phase-3`) follow
`../project/research-app-fllicker.md`, which finds the sources of refresh
flicker and sequences the fixes.

`## Ready` is ordered by dependency — top of the list is genuinely the next
thing that can be started.

## Ready


- [ ] [T-0131] Measure refresh traffic after Phase 1 ships; record the Phase 2 go/no-go | prio:med | tags:gui,flicker-fix,phase-1 | detail:details/T-0131.md | created:2026-08-02
- [ ] [T-0111] Close the drag-behaviour test gap: non-displacing placeholder and/or a JS test runner (T-0110 follow-up) | tags:gui,test,tech-debt | detail:details/T-0111.md | created:2026-08-01

## Blocked

- [ ] [T-0132] Library: expose per-file stamps for region-level change detection | prio:med | tags:library,flicker-fix,phase-2 | detail:details/T-0132.md | created:2026-08-02 | blocked:report Phase 2; gate on T-0131 saying region-level diffing is justified
- [ ] [T-0133] Broker: publish per-column events from a per-file diff; detail-body edits fire nothing | prio:med | tags:gui,flicker-fix,phase-2 | detail:details/T-0133.md | created:2026-08-02 | blocked:needs T-0132 and the T-0131 go
- [ ] [T-0134] Per-column fragment routes and hx-triggers (gated on T-0131) | prio:med | tags:gui,flicker-fix,phase-2 | detail:details/T-0134.md | created:2026-08-02 | blocked:needs T-0133; only if T-0131 shows board re-fetches dominate
- [ ] [T-0135] CSS transition polish on swap (fade .htmx-added content) | prio:low | tags:gui,flicker-fix,phase-3 | detail:details/T-0135.md | created:2026-08-02 | blocked:report Phase 3; only if Phase 1 still feels abrupt
- [ ] [T-0136] Morph the theme shell swap to preserve focus and scroll | prio:low | tags:gui,flicker-fix,phase-3 | detail:details/T-0136.md | created:2026-08-02 | blocked:report Phase 3; needs idiomorph (T-0128); measure shell-swap cost first

## Someday

- [ ] [T-0043] Implement archive for rolling months into done-YYYY.md | prio:low | tags:library,ops | created:2026-07-29
- [ ] [T-0044] Implement migrate for older directory layouts | prio:low | tags:library,ops | created:2026-07-29
- [ ] [T-0045] Implement stats: throughput, cycle time, WIP over time | prio:low | tags:library,report | created:2026-07-29
- [ ] [T-0040] Pin the published module path in go.mod | prio:low | tags:setup | created:2026-07-29 | deferred:the module does not need to be published yet
